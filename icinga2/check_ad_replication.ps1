# Revision History:
# 2012-08-25	Bastian W. [Bastian@gmx-ist-cool.de]		1.0 (initial version)
# 2016-03-20	Bastian W. [Bastian@gmx-ist-cool.de]		1.1  code adjusted:
#																* updated script for Windows 2012R2 compatibility
#
# Info:
# This powershell plugin for the NSClient++ can be used to monitor the replication (and performance counters) from a Microsoft ActiveDirectory Domain Controller based on Windows 2008 / 2008 R2
# It monitors the domain controllers replication status with its neighbors and if the number of consecutive sync failures will be '0' (means there is no error during replication) it collects performance counters from the DRA (directory replication agent). If the sync error value is greater than '1' for any partition for any neighbor, an error will be flagged and the failed neighbor will be reported to nagios and an additional email is send out to a system administrator with more infos.

# FAQ:
#	How To solve "cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system. Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details."
# 	See: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176949.aspx [a possible solution would be 'Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned']
#
# Installation:
#
# 1.)
# Create a folder on C:\ called "NagiosMonitoring" if it didn´t exist, and put this script into that folder.
#
# Note: If you use another Foldername, you need to change this script completly!
#
# 2.)
# Now start a Powershell and run the following comands (to test if the script is working for you)
# "C:"
# "cd NagiosMonitoring"
# ".\NagiosMonitoring_AD_ReplicationCheck.ps1"
#
# 3.)
# Add this script to the NSClient++ configuration (file: NSC.ini)
#
# [External Scripts]
# ADDCReplicationCheck=cmd /c echo C:\NagiosMonitoring\NagiosMonitoring_AD_ReplicationCheck.ps1 | PowerShell.exe -Command -
#
# 4.)
# On the check_nrpe command include the -t 30, since it takes some time to load the Exchange cmdlet's.
# 
# 5.)
# uncommend CheckExternalScripts.dll in the NSClient++ configuration (file: NSC.ini)
#
# 6.)
# restart the NSClient++ Service
#
# 7.)
# You need to edit the config below
#
#   Configuration:
#   ====================
#   Specify here from which email adress the emails should come from
#   Syntax: $strMailFrom = "ADMonitoringSolution@yourcompany.com";
	$strMailFrom="ADMonitoringSolution@yourcompany.com";
#
#   Specify here to which email adress the notifications should be send to
#   Syntax: $strMailTo = "you@yourcompany.com";
	$strMailTo = "you@yourcompany.com";
#
#   Specify here via which SMTP server the notification emails should be send
#   Syntax: $strMailServer = "yourmailserver.ads";
	$strMailServer = "yourmailserver";
#
#   Specify here which email subject should be used
#   Syntax: $strMailSubject = "MS AD Monitoring - Replication issues detected!";
	$strMailSubject = "MS AD Monitoring - Replication issues detected!";

The value should be low, with a higher value indicating that the hardware is incapable of adequately servicing replication (warranting a server upgrade).
